# My default IPython profile

Some basic config:

- Use Source Code Pro as my code font in QtConsole and Notebook
- Load a few of my [extensions](https://github.com/minrk/ipython_extensions)
- Add autosave and gist sharing to the Notebook
- minor styling of the Notebook
- use msgpack if it's available
- use a password on the notebook, stored in my Keychain
- reduce heartbeat time to 1/4 second in IPython.parallel
- load up some common libraries I always use in startup (os, sys, time, pyzmq, numpy)
